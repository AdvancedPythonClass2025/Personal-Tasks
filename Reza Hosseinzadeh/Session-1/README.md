# Factorial project

## Introduction
Welcome to the Factorial project! This Python script is designed to compute the factorial of a specified integer, demonstrating essential programming techniques such as loops, conditionals, and function definitions.

## Project Details

- **Title:** Factorial
- **Date of Submission:** February 29, 2025
- **Branch:** task/Reza-hosseinzade/Factorial
- **Main File:** 
  - `task1.py`

## Description
This project implements a straightforward algorithm to calculate the factorial of a number. The script prompts the user for input, processes the calculation using loops and conditions, and outputs the final result.

## Challenges Faced
During the development process, I encountered a challenge with the placement of error handling using try-except blocks. Initially, I attempted to implement it within the function, which led to complications. I resolved this by moving the error handling outside the function, resulting in a more robust solution.

## Skills Developed
- [ ] Gained foundational skills in using loops, conditional statements, and defining functions in Python.
