# Car Management System Project

## Introduction
Welcome to the Car Management System project! This Python script is designed to manage car objects, allowing users to create, display, and modify car attributes. It demonstrates essential programming techniques such as class definitions, methods, and object-oriented programming.

## Project Details

- **Title:** Car Management System
- **Date of Submission:** 11-03-2025
- **Branch:** task/Reza-Hosseinzade/car_management
- **Main File:** 
  - `car_management.py`

## Description
This project implements a simple car management system using a class called `mashin`. The script allows users to create car objects with attributes such as model, year of manufacture, color, and weight. Users can display car information and change the color of the cars.

## Challenges Faced
- I faced a challenge while implementing the method to change the car color. I had to ensure that the previous color was stored and displayed correctly after the change, which required careful handling of class attributes.

## Skills Developed
- [ ] Gained foundational skills in using classes and methods in Python.
- [ ] Improved problem-solving skills by addressing challenges related to attribute management.
